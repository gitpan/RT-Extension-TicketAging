This RT extension will install into your RT local library directory.

  perl Makefile.PL
  make

Then with appropriate permissions for your RT installation (probably sudo)

  make install

This extension needs to add a the custom "Age" field and scrips to
your RT database. Again, with the approrpriate RT permissions:

  make initdb

Shredder is used for Destroyed age, so you have to create directory
for backups in the RT's 'var' directory. See also description
of the TicketAgingFilenameTemplate option in the docs.

  mkdir /opt/rt3/var/data/RT-Shredder/

Add 'use RT::Extension::TicketAging;' line to the bottom of the RT
site config.

Next step is optional and MUST be skipped in productions environment
as during this step data is created in the current RT DB. Many tests
may fail if you didn't initialize DB or the directory for backups
doesn't exist.

  make test
